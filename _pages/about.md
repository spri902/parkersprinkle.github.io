Hi, I'm Parker. 

I'm an Earth Scientist at Pacific Northwest National Lab (PNNL) and a PhD student at the University of Washington.

I'm interested in and research a variety of topics under the umbrella of seismology. In recent years, I've worked mostly with Distributed Acoustic Sensing (DAS) technology in an effort to better understand how seismologists can fold this new sensing technology into our existing tool-kit. I've worked with DAS recordings from underground explosions, enhanced geothermal reservoirs, and near surface environmental characterization sites. 
For me DAS technology is so interesting because it lives at the intersection of geophysics, data science, and high performance computing. It's quite easy to generate > 1-2 TB of data each day with a DAS array. This presents quite a challenge for data storage, transfer and processing. Over the summer of 2023 I've been working on reconstucting DAS recordings from small subsets of the original data, a method known as compressive sensing, with various optimization techniques.
